                <p>A website detailing the history of trackers such as Octamed for the Commodore Amiga and their role in early Drum & Bass / Jungle, along with tutorials on how to emulate the Amiga and use Octamed on modern computers. Accompanying the site was a mockup for a 12" vinyl single with two tracks made with Octamed.  <br><br>
                    The site and cover art reference early 3d rendering and effects popular in 90's Jungle rave posters.
